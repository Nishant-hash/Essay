    1.First day of my school
I am a grown student now. I read in class ten. These days, I remember my past days and laugh myself. Now, I can remember the first day of my school. It was perhaps I was about five years old. My father was not at home. My mother took me to school. The school was not very far. It was at a distance of about half an hour on foot.
She talked to a tall  man first. Perhaps he was the head teacher of the school. Then she took me to a class. There was a miss in the room. She called me calling my name. She hugged me and said, " welcome my class."
I became vvery happy. I went to the classroom. We sang and clapped . They asked my name. I said," I am Sarita.".I made a friend. She was Binita. But when my mother got out of the room. I started sobbing ran after mother catching her sari. Then, again, my mother returned to the class. This time, mother had embraced me. We stayed in the class for a while. Miss told mother to take me home. But from the next day, I went to school happily.

2.Education
Education is light of life. It is also said the cultivation of life. Education makes a man social and civilized. Education gives us knowledge, skills and techniques to use in our pratical field. It gives us idea to do things and to find out the right and wrong, good and bad etc.
Because of the skills , knowledge  and techniques, we can work very well. Skillful persons can produce more and better than uneducated persons. Educations is the permanent property of a person. Nobody can steal it. They can get jobs easily. They do not have to suffer in their life. Their lives are easier and happier.
Educated people can see the social problems. They can also see the remedies to solve them. They are always thinking of something for improving their societies. They give light to the society. Educated people think about the people of the society because only few educated people cannot make the society civilized. They are always aware of the good condition of the society. So, education is the most important thing for a person.

3.Education for girls
Education is light of life. It is also the cultivation of life. Education makes a man  social and civilized. Education gives us knowledge and skills.
Girls are about half of the total population. The girls today are the mothers of tomorrow. It is said mother is the first teacher and home is the first school of the child. So, mothers must learn to make the child educated.If a man is educated, he can be educated alone, but if we educate a woman we can educate the whole family. If the women are educated, they will get jobs, they can live on their own . They willnot have to face problems.
Men and women are like two wheels of a cart. If one wheel of the cart is unwell, it can not run well. So, if women are uneducated, they  can not help us to develop the country.
Educated men and uneducated women cannot be good husband and wife because they cannot hav egood understanding.
In addition to these, education is for enabling personality. If the women are educated, they will be independent. They will not have to depend on their husband.So, it is necessary to educate the girls also for social justice. Therefore, for the all-round development of a country, we must educate girls and make them able.

4.Importance of Technical Education
Everybody knows, education is the backbone for  the development of a country. We can get knowledge from education. Education gives us skills and techniques. So, we can use the knowledgeand skills in the field we like. So only the educated persons can live happily.
We have general and techinical education. General education means the study of theoretical subjects like English, Nepali, Mathematics, Social Studies etc. Technical education is pratical education. Computer operating, tailoring, carpentary, engineering, medical study, etc are common technical subjects. The study of lab technology, nursing, health, science, dental science, engineering, agro technology,(JTs, JTAs) etc are the technical subjects.
If we get this type of education, we can get simple jobs. Nowadays, people have a thought that students should get a job as soon as they get through a level. It is true that the poverty in the society has compelled to think so. If students get a technical education, it is easier for them to get a job. We can spread both kind of education together. But, Technical education has been a need of time.

5.Why we should send our children to school
Children are the citizens of tomorrow. It is a known fact that this is the most important time for a person. THis is the most active, energetic and enthusiastic time of life. Like this, school is the temple where knowledge and skills are spread around.So we can realize children  and schools are like blood and muscle of the body.
The child hood is a learning time. They learn what they can hear, do or see. If they are exposed to bad  environment, they will learn bad things.
If they are sent to schiools, they will learn to read, write, get relationship with educational personalities etc. They will be educated. THey wil pass their time for building their future life.In the same way, if they don't go to school, they will have to mix up with the street boys and pass thier time in dust.
The children today are the responsible citizens of tomorrow. WHat will be the future society be like then? So only if we educate our children now, they can be educated and skillful.
6.Student Life
A person has to go through childhood, youth, adult, old and very old stages. The student life is the first and most important stage of life.
This period begins from birth to 25 years of age. This is the most fertile stage of life. THis is the training period for a person. One gets formal education from schools and colleges and informal education from families.
Learning is easier and faster in this period.It is because a person's mind is fresh to learn.Once they hear, see and do something they hardly forget it.This is the time when the children are most eagerous to learn anything. This is the time to learn manners, get skills and knowledge for  the whole life. If we cannot get education in this stage teh life may be very difficult in future.
THerefore, the students have to listen to their parents. They should listen to their teachers. Habit can be formed and reformed. THis makes a eprson's nature. The next, students should make their role models. So that the get a right route for success.They can keep in mind hnow they can be like those people. Together, students must read books written by advanced writers. Thus this is the most important period of whole life.
7. How we can learn
A person is different from another. So a person learns the same thing in different ways because they have different nature. In the same way subjects are different. Theya re best learnt in different ways. So, we learns things in many ways.
We learn by reading books. We learn by listening to our parents and our teachers. We learn by looking thinsg. We learn by doing ourselves. We learn by talking to the neighbours. We learn by travelling to places and interviewing the people etc.
A practical subject like scinec is well learnt in a practical way by doing. HIstory can be learnt by listening to teachers. SOme part sof histroy can be learnt by observing the sites. Social studes are best learnt by visiting communities and talking to people.
Geography and the social tradition of a certain place can be learnt by visiting places. We  can talk to people, ask quesetiona dn learn in a communicative way. 
The next, we can best learn our culture by being involved in the family and social activities. But the mathematical problesm are learnt by practising with the help of teachers. So, we learn in  many ways.
8. Importance of English language
People speak many languages in the world. Nepal is a small country but we speak hundred languages. BUtnNepal i s the link language for the people. Like this English is a link language for the world people.
English language is very important these days. THer eare some important reasons. English language is an offical language in teh UNO. If you have to get a job in foreighn offices, you must learn English. Most important books for higher studies are written in English. It is spoken almost all over the world. It is world link language.you must know English. If you have to use internet , if you have to go to some other countries. If you like to get higher education, if you like to be business man, if you like to start a hotel in Neplai market etc. Foreigh tourists come to our country and you should speak English. If you like to get a job in a foreign coutnry you must have English. 
English language is also easy to learn. It ahs vey easy rules. If you really like to learn t, you can learn to speak English within three months. Becuase of the reason it's clear that English is very important language.
9.Child Right.
Child means a human in his /her early stage of life, te most important time of life. Right means the power that is given by state  'laws.' .So, child right means the power a child can bring into practise. A child should be given some basic right . The first thing, the child should get is a chance to eat hygenic. Food. live in a comfortable place and have good friends. The next, he should get love. Like-wise, the next important thing is the chance to learn.He should equally get a chance of games and entertainment.
Developmetn of a child means - physical , mental, social and pscychological development . A child is in our palm. We can make him what we like. THe great person of our societies today,a re the products of societyof thepast.
Therefore the children should get chnaces to develop their personality. We should empoewer the children now so we will get qualified citizenstomorrows. If we educate them today, we will get educated and qualified manpowerfor tomorrow. SO, the most important thing is that we should give them: hygienic food, environment,education, time to enjoy and lvoe. These are the basic things for a child.
10. Value of time
'Time and Tide wait for none.'. It is a popular English proverb. Proverbs are the products of long experiences . Time is the same things as the flowing river. Once it passes, it never comes back again. The time once passed, cannot be used b us. Time is roughtly divided into three parts.They are past, present and future. Past is already passed. YOu can not get it back. Future is always uncertain. You cannot foretell it. But the present is your time. You can use it as you like. A person's life is in his own hand. WHat do you like to make yourselves? Make plan and mould it in the present time. 
Our life is like the time. It is also flowing like the water of a river, blowing like the wind and passing together with the time. An adult cannot get his childhood back again. A person is strong, active, energetic and intelligent in his youth. He can do many things in this stage. BUt he can not do in his old stage. So, time is very much important. In case of students, it is more important than otherperson. So, we should  be aware of time. If we miss time. It is like the blown wind or flowed water. We cannto catch it again. So, we must be aware of time. We should learn wel. It is our time.
11.Discipline
Discipline means the training of mind and character. In simple words, it means to develop habit of likely manners.
It is very necessary for every body. What will happen if the soldiers do not follow the commander in the battle field? It is equally important in the student life because student life is the training period for the whole life. It is the time to build good character and personality.
In common sense discipline means only to be a silent follower and to listen to the seniors. But it is not discipline. A disciplined person tells the truth and facts in a polite way. He can present his views in a good manner.
Discipline is an ornament of a person. It furnishes and adds scent in one's life. It is necessary for every one if s/he likes to  make him/herself a great person, good person and respected person. Who will follow an undisciplined leader? He may be followed for a short period of time, but sooner or later he willl be rejected . No country can be developed if its people are not disciplined and do not follow the national rules. So, discipline is a necessary thing for us.
12.Good Manners.
Good means nice and manners mean the behaviours of person. So, here, good manners means, likely behaves of persons.
What are the good manners? THe most important thing is the speech of a person. It is the most important thing because you can impress a person with your speaking at the very first time,. It depends upon whether you respect others. If you do not respect others. They will not respect you. If you do not speak politely and donot resepectothers, you may be taken as a rude person. People donot like such persons.
Then one's activities are taken. How sincere is one? If you do anything sincereely and you keep your words, yo uare taken as an hones person. BUt if you do not care time and the person with who you are talking to , they will not take you a good person.
So, politeness,respectful behaves, honesty, punctuality, sincerity are the measuring rods to check a person. One should do thing sin time. It is said, early to bed, early to rises makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise. THerefore, in conclusion, the sound habits are good manners.
13.My aim in Life
I am student now. Like others I have my aim in life. We know that a person without an aim is like a boat without a rudder. They will have no destination. Those who can not dream can not get success in life. So I have got an aim. I want to be a journalist.
I am sure I will pass SLC examination in the first division. Then I will study English and journalism. I will work very hard while studying. I will study geography, history,political science. OUr teachers says  it is necessary to have information of many social affairs to be journalist. So  I will pass my free time in the library. I will not miss any chance of educational excursions.

18.My plan after SLC Examination
Now, I am preparing for the SLC examination. I have no free time to visit my relatives or to see any new placces. I have not got enough time to watch TV. 
After takin my SLC examination, I will be free for some time.So,I will do some thing of my interest. First of all, I will enjoy watching TV and watch a few recently released movies. After a few days, I will visit my uncle in Pokhara. I will go to the Fewa Lake first and go boating. Then I will see the Mahendra Cave and see other natural scences. I will then visiti Lamjung, where my parents were born. I will stay with my aunt there. I will spend a couple of days there. Then I will move to Bandipur where my maternal grand parents live. After a couple days stay there  I will comeback home. 
After these visits, I will come back home and join bridge course for science . I will do my best in the preparation class. I will be well prepared for the entrance exam in the college of my choice. In addition, I will join a computer class and learn it well. I will next listen to my seniors, teachers and best wishers for teh best way I can do in my study. I know that it is the most important itime. I have to be very careful in my study.
19.If I were the Mayor
I'm now a class ten student. So I'm careful in my study. But, I cannot be blind about social activities too. WHen I am going to school, I can't reach school in time. The road is blocked with vehicles and goods for sale. I don't know when I will fall into a drain. the roads have been badly destroyed that the rainy seasons there are small ponds and in the dry days we are lost in teh dust. 
So, I think if I were the mayor of my municipality I'd do something to solve these problems. First of all I'd try to sovle the traffic e problem. For this, I would ask the traffice police to be strict. Together I would reqeust the businessmen to help clean the streets. 
The next, I would give high priority to road swithin my municipality. SO the people would feel comfortableto go through the city. After doing these,  i would make plasn for long run programmes for the developement of my municipality. I would then give high priority to electricity. SO the people would run their industries easily. The studenst would feel no problem to study. Like this, I would do a lot of things if I were the Mayor of my municipality.
20.If I were the Head teacher of my school
Now I'm a class ten student. I have seen many problems in my school. I think they are not very hard to solve. we can solve them if we try. If I were the headteacher , first of all I'd build a library in schiool so taht teachers and students could use their free time and learn. I would make every reporst monlty or some more frequently. The next, I would set up a science lab. Science is a  practical subject. If students learn it practically they can learn faster. 
COmputer has been a basic need today. Ihave thought into practice.  I would provide computer classes for my students. I would appoint an excellent game teacher. So, the student would get chance to play modern games. Gmaes are necessary things for all the round developementof a person. It owould develop thier personality as well as discipline. 
Finally, I would make my students take part in extra curricular activeies. Extracurricula activities will activate their inherent talent. I would do the above things to make an excellent schiool if I were the head teacher of my school.
21.If I were a doctor in my local hospital
Ï'm a class ten student now and I'm in preparation for the SLC examination. I think of many things regarding to my society. I have seen so many people dying of or suffering from many diseases.
If I were a doctor of my local hospital, I would save them from these dangers. I would educate the people clean water and fresh food. the next, I would tell them abou the necessary factors needed in food. 
The next thing, I woudl start a paying clinic in addition to my normal duty. THen I would check them for a nomial fee. But, I would give the old people first priority . I would give them the sample medicine free of cost. I would save some time for my studay and research works. I would help the medical sector finding out new facts.
I would open ahealth club in my community. It will teach how to keep the environment clean to be safe from communicable disease. Hence, If I were a doctor, I would certainly do something for me, my people and for my nation.
22.Education Tour/ Excursion
Tour means visiting plaes. people travel from place to place for different purposes. Some travel for getting education , some for business, some for entertainment and some for visiting religious places as pilgrims.
Educational Tour or excursion means a tour of a students to be a certain place for a certain time for certain purposes.
Educational tour is a part of practical learning. Students learn by reading or listening to teacher and doing very littl ein the labs in our schools. But in such tourss, students learn by observation. They can see the real objects, people an places. Students can read in books. BUt the taste of real visit is far more ifferent andeffective than their theoretical study. They can talk to the people and ask them whatever they like.They learn to live in groups. They learn to face difficulties in a different situation. They can experience new things.
They may feel freedom while in the tour, but together the students also learn many things informally. They cna see innumerable things out of their plan. So, educational tour is very important to us.
23.An Educational tour I have taken part.
I was in nine last year. OUr teachers decided to take us to Pokhara. As soon as the bus left the school, we started singing and dancing. We reached Pokhara at nine thirty very happily.
We went to PN campus first of all. A staff of the college showed us different faculities, the library, the lab and class rooms. Then we went to the museum. We saw the birds, butter flies, insects, animals and plants there. We felt as if they were real.
After that we visisted Gandaki School at Lama Chaur. What a big area! We wondered seeing the buildings, class rooms, library, and science lab, playground etc. Then we went to the Mahendra Cave from there. At the end we came to our hotel . The next morning, we visited Bindabasini temple and rushed to the Fewa Lake. We looked at the shadow of the Machapucchre Himal in the Fewa Lake. We boated ther eand went to the Talbarahi temple.
We enjoyed a pcinic at the Begnas lake. WE cooked ourselves. We enjoyed singing, dancing and taking photographs; and eating together. We set out for home at 4. We arrived at our school at eight.
24.The Historical place I have visited.
Tow years ago, I visited Gorakha with my grandfather. We took a bus from BUtwal at 7 a.m . We reached the bus park of Gorakha at 1 o'clock. We had to visit our relative there. Grandpa said we would visit the Kalika temple and gGorakha Durbar the next day.
As soon as we got off the bus. We clibed a little up to a hill. We had a short rest there. It was a very pleasant place to look at. I looked at the southern side. I saw the slope land and hilly villages. My grand father toldd me abou the place. We went to the relatives's house then.
The next day, he took me to Kalika temple on top of the hill. We saw the temple. We saw the birth place of Prithivi Narayan Shah. Later we saw the Durbar. We saw the Topkhana. We could see the weapons he had used to fight and overcome the enemies. 
Most people were farmers there. Some people were business men. They were simple and helpful. ow, I realize that this plae is very important. This needs protection and care because it is important from the point of view of Nepalese History.
25.A visit to zoo or national park.
We were in class nine last year. We decided to visit the zoo. We were about twenty students in the team. We reserved a micro bus from the nearest bus stop and went to the national zoo at Jawlakhel, Lalitpur. SInce we are students, we got  a reduced rate for the entracne. We had to pay only rs 5 per head.
As we entered  the zoo, we saw the varieties of birds. I wondered looking at so many birds. The ostrih was so big very hard to believe. Then we looked at the tigers. They  looke poor an hopeless. Perhpas they were fed up of the ready mae meat they usually get. 
The next we looked at the deer, monkeys an many others. The long tailed monkey with its black face  looked fvery dangerous. A littl eboy had just tried to give the monkey a chocolate; it grabbed his hand and injured him. The next attraction I found was the snakes. I had never guessed so many of the snakes  are found and kept in the zoo.
After a long walking roun the zoo, we were tired an hungry. So, we had khaja and got back for home. But the animals that love the free life are kept in the zoo. It is like a jail. We have exploited the animals for our sake.
26.A religious place I like to visit
Our country is rich in natural beauty, religious places, historial places and others. Ihave heard about many interesting places .But, I have visited very few of them. So, I like to visit a religious place, Jankapur. 
I have heard that it lies in Janakpur zone an Dhanusha district. It is a popular religiousplace of the Hindus. They say there is Ram Jankai Temlpe. They organize a fair on the day of Bihbah Panchami every year. It is in the memory of Lord Ram and Sita, who is the daughter of Nepal.
It is popular because Ram, the ogd of HInus had married to Sita in Jankpur.Sita was the daughter of a popular king janak. Janak was also a religious king. He worked very hard for his people. He even ploughed the field. According to the legend, Sita was found when the king Janak had been ploughing the field. And that she was made for ram from the blood fo Rishis.
So, I have made a plan that I will visit Janakpur sooner or later. I will take photographs there an dI will aslo see the peopl e, talk to them and learn  a lot about their culture.I wil lfeel the real taste of terai life. I will hear how the people speak and see how they live. So, I am really interested to visit Janakpur.
27.An unforgettable event of my life.
One day when I was in class nine, my friends made a plan for a tour. We decided to go to Lumbini. We made a plan to go early and see the historical shrines in LUmbini. WE set out early in the morning on a Saturday.
When we reached Daunne, it had already been 7 am. Most passengers got off there to see teh Gomba and the bus was almost empty. The driver disappeared. We waited for an hour but nobody came there. We went searching them. WE found them inside a hotel playing cards. It had been 9.30 by then. When we asked the bus staff replied that they had to wait for the passengers who had gone to the Gomba. We shouted against them.
A crowe of people gathered in no time. Some people took our side. At last he was ready to refund us.
We took another bus to Lumbini. We reached there at two and looke at the Gombas made by many foreigners there; and teh popular Mayadev temple and the peace flame. It gotfive by then so we came back home at about nine o'clock at night. I can never forget this event in my life.
28.Importance of extra curricular activities.
The students learn the same bookks and apper the same examination. But, some students are far better than other. Becuase, some take part in the extra curricular activities and other don't. For the all round development of a student, only the course books and class room activities are not enought. Extra curricular activities play very important role.
These may be games, quiz contests,spelling contest, dancing, singing, oratory contest, drawing, writing poems, stories, essays etc .Games will help them develop their body; keep healthy, learn discipline and other activities will help broaden their mind. To educte means , to develop the inherent capacity of the students. We shoul give them chances to take part in the activities of their interest. Everyone like to win and show one self superior to others. SO, even if a student is weak at theoretical study, he/she can be brilliant at other extra curricular activities.
Moreover, they enjoy taking part in competitions. If they get chances to take part in these activities , they will use free time and can be safe from unlikely activities.
29.Value of Sports.
Sports means games. Some games are played inside and some games are played outside of hall. Chess, table tennis, carrom board etc are the games played inside. These are called in=door games. Football, volleyball, badminton, relay race, kapardi, dandi biyo etc, are played on the ground outside the shed. These are known as outdoor games.
WE can get many advantages from games. There is a feeling of competition in every game. So every player wants to win. They areinterested to take part in such activities. The young boys and girls an use their free time playing. The games are full of physical an mental exercises. The players have goodhealth and are always fit because of the exercise. A healthy body can have a healthy mind. So, the players are intelligent, too.
Every game has certain rules. The players have to follow them strictly. This teaches teh plaers good lessons. So they learn how to follow rules and regulation; and be disciplined.
A nation's development depends on the disciplined, active and healthy people. Games are the major factors to develop these characteristics in the citizens. So sports are very much important for the development of a country.
30.My Country Nepal
Nepal is my country. It is in thenorthen hemisphere. It has trhee geographical zones - Himalayan, mountainour and terai. we have monsoon climate. It is very cold and dry in winter; and hot stormy and rainy in summer. It is rich in natural beauty and resources. It has long and wide rivrs like Koshi, Ganaki and Karnali. we have large lakes like Rupa, Begnas, rara etc, Like-wise we have green valleys, lovely water falls etc. It is rich in religious and historical heritage. Lumbini, Gorakha, Jankpur, Kathmandu are the famous examples.

Tourists love to visit our country. They can see endagnered birds and animals here. They can se natural beauty, too. So, tourism is our potential industry.
31.Democracy
Thw ord democracy is popular in the field of politics. Abraham Lincoln said democracy is to the people, by the people, for the people. There is no autocrat or dictator in this political system. The rulers and people elect legislative  members. They makes rules to apply in the country. There is a system an the system rules every one.
We have many advantagesin this system. No boy can be a ictator. If any leaer goes against the laws, they are punished. If the leaders acts against national interest people can punish them. They can elect next leader in the election. This makes the leaders more responsible . SO, they cannot go against the people.
Some Say there are disadvantage.People may think they are free. There should be no control over people. They are the supreme power holders. So, their behaves may be seen undisciplined. Some political leaders may think of only the interest of their party members. But we can correct this slowly.
32.Fashion
Fashion means style.Fashion looks in: wearing dress, combing hari, walking, speaking etc. W see people do things in different ways. They think it is modern. It is lovable . They walk in different ways. They wear clothes in different ways. They comb hair in a new style. Once there was a time, young people used to wear their pants with a wide opening at teh bottom . It was called bell bottom.
Once there was a fashion. Most unmarried girls used to wear trousers. inside their frocks. These days, young boys like weraing jeans with many pockets. They even choose pants that look old, torn and faded. The girls have a fashion to keep long nails with different paints and wear pants or middy avove the knees.
Fashions spread all over the world in no time because of the television and the interenet. As teh actors and actresses change their styles, the young ones quickly copy them and look in the same style. It is the whim of young age. So, we should take it as a common phenomenal.
33.Qualities of National Leader.
Leader is a person who works for people. He is an active person in politics. There are many leaders in our country but it is very difficult to find a national leader. It needs some uniques qualities to be national leader.The first and the most important thing is that he must have a clear vision for the country. He should have foresightedness . He should have aim an dtakes steps towards aim.
The next is that the national leaders should be brave. They may have to face serious problems. They may be criticized by the party workers. But, he should not be fearful. He should be ready to die for the nation> The national leaders are always at a height whetehr they are in power or not. They are far from corruption and relatives. They do not listen to the party workers if their demands are for personal interest. THey ignore the luxurious life. Such hleader shave very simple life like the common people.
They are always against corruption. They are always ready to punish the corrupt person even though they ar ethe worker sof their own party or they are the relatives.
Sometimes,t ehy have to make a decision against their won party for the betterment of the nation. Such leaders stand high and are praised by the people. They are the national leaders.
34.My village then and now.
I live in a village. The name of my village is Surya Nagar. When I was a little child my village was backwarded. I can remember the houses were small. They were  made of dry sticks and dry grass. Only a few houses were made of bricks. We had no electricity. We read in kerosene lamp. The roads were narrow. They were muddy in summer and dusty in winter. We had a primary school.
Now , my village has been changed a lot. Most of the houses are concrete buildings. We have electricity. We can watch TV, operate coputer, and refrigerators, grind things, run fans in the hot days, heat water in teh cold months etc. We have telephones.
The roads have been gravelled.We have a  bus service to the city. We can go to hospital in need. We have a higher secondary school in our nvillage. We need not go far away for school education. There is a service of health assistant and a mid-wife inour health post. WE have got a police post for security.
We have a library int he village. We have a small market. Our village has changed and developed a lot.
35.My village.
The name of my vilage is Simari. It is in the plains of the terai regiion. It lies in the western developement region. Lumbini zone, andRupandehi district. 
We have a monsoon climate here It is cold in winter but hot in summer. It also rains heavily in the rainy season with strong wind and storms.
There are about two hundred families in my village. Most of teh people are Tharus, Some are Brahmin, Kshetries. Bishwokarma and Gurungs and Magars. The rest few  are from other castes. 
Most people follow Hindu religion but some are Buddhists an some are Christians. Some speak their own language but most people speak Neplai Language.

Almost all the people in my village are farmers. They work very hard in their field and grow crops. They keep cows, buffaloes, hens, goats and ducks etc. Somepeople have services in government and private offices. and soe have small business.
Our village does not have many facilities. We have dusty roads. They get mudy in teh summer. We have electricity but it does not supply power regularly. WE have a secondary school in the village. ANy way my village is a beautiful, joyful and peaceful place to live. I love  my village.
36. My city.
I live in Butwal . It is in the plains. It is in the western part of Nepal. It is in Lumbini zone. Rupandehi district. It is on the East west Highway and on the way to Palpa from bhairahawa. We have a monsoon climate. It is very hot in the summer and cold in winter. IT rains heavily in the rainy season. 
Peopl from many castes and religions live in the city. Most of the people are Newars, Brahmins, Kshetris, Gurungs, Magars, VishwoKarmas, Guptas etc. In the smae way, Hindus are in majority but Bauddhism, Christian and Islam relition are followed by many other people. 
Most of the people in my city ar eengaged in business but some are service holders and some are manufacturers of various things. Some are teachers of private and public schools and colleges. SOme are working int eh hospitals and nursing homes. 
We have public and privates hospitals. We have many public and private schools and colleges here.WE have electricity, telephone and many other facilities. WE have Lumbini, an internationally popular place. But it is being polluted everyday because of population growth. Any way, my city is very good. I'm proud of my city.
37.Village Life
Nepal is a mountainous country. People live in villages. The life of the villages is simple. They grows crops, vegetables, fruits etc. They keep cattle like buffaloes, cows and get fresh milk,calves and fertilizer for their land. They also pet goats, sheep, and hens and produce meat and eggs.
they don't have other sources of income. They have to sell their products at a cheap rate. They don't have agricultural facilities. Most people are poor and hardworking. They can't get easy loan from teh banks. But, they are happy. 
The people are very helpful and honest in the village. WHen guests come, they behave them as gods. They love their neighbours. They love their cultrue. They are healthy because they eat fresh food. They live in fresh atmosphere.
They also have some problems. They sometimes get sick and they can not get quick treatement because there is no good hospital or health post nor is good transport to go to the city hospital.
There are not modern facilities, no electricity, ltelephone, internet, post office, police posts etc .If wer are able to improve the conditions a little, we can get a happy and healthy life in the villages.
38. City Life
Cities are grwoing very fast in our coutnry. Population is also growing fast in the cities because there are many facilities in the cities than in the villages. 
We can get public and private schools and colleges. There are hospitals and clinics. WE can get transport and communication  facilities. There is electricity. We can use modern invention . We  can use computers, E-mail and internet. We can learn about the world sitting in our homes. THere are cinemas, computer and language institution etc. Governemtn offices, industries, big business firms are found in the cities. WE can get education, quick treatment, jobs and funs too. These facilities have attracted people. 
But, the city life is not easy as it is seen.The pollutin in the city is the main problem. There is dirt in every corner. There are noise and crowd eery wehre. People may get a job but it is not enough to live. So, they are busy in more than one job. People have no time. Everyone is runnig because of their increasing necessities.
They don't know each other. Peol are only running to earn money. They don't care good or bad. Any way city life is luxurious and attractive.
39.A village life is better than a city life.
Nepal is a country of villages. However, many cities are emerging very fast. People prefer living in cities to living int eh vilalge. They find many transport, communication schools and colleges, job opportunites, hospitals etc.
They think they can enjoy modern life. But they don't care that ther eare so many problems. There is always noise and horror. There is pollution. There is dirt.There is traffice jam.
People are busy and restless. They have no time for rest and see their relatives when they are in troubles. They have not ime to enjoy social life.Although ther eare no good roads, schools and modern facilities, village life is very good life. People grow crops, vegetables and pet animals. They can get fresh food and live in a fresh environment. Their life is very simple. They have very few needs. When they are fulfilled, they are happy. They celebrate their traditional fesetivals and enjoy a lot. They help each other. They respect their guests. They enjoy social life. When there is a problem in a family of their community, they help them. There fore I like village life more than a city life.
40. Life of The people in the mountains.
Nepal is a coutnry of moutains.Nepal is divided into three geographical regions. They are Himalalyan., Mountainour and Terai regions. About 84 percent of the land lies in this region.
Mountainour life spreads from Ilam tomhakali. People of many castes and religions live there. The major castes are Brahmin, Kshetry, Gurung, Magar, VishoKarma, Newar, Thakali etc. The main religions are Hinduism, Baddihsm, Christianty and Muslim. So they havve different languages and culture, and traditions. Most houses are made of stone, mud and dry grass but these days they have been tin roofed.
Most people in this region are farmers. They grow crops, pet animals and birds like hen, pigeon etc .They grow vegetables and fruits, too. Someplaces are developedThere are small markets.So some people are servie holders and businessmen.
Life of this region ies very difficult. People have to walk ups and downs on the hills. Their homes are on a hill and they have to go to far away for working. They even have to carry their drinking water from distant places.
They have very few facilities. There are not good motorable roads. There is no reliable electricy. There ar enot good schools and colleges. If we can improve a little, this life can be a happy life.
41.A farmer
A farmer is a person who works in the field and grows food for us. His life is very hard. He has to work a lot everyday. he doesnot get free time. 
When he has to plant rice, he has to depend on rainfuall. If it doesnot rain in time, he cannot plant rice. The next, he does not get enough fertilizer in time, neither  has he got improved seed. When it is time of harvest. he is always fearful of snow and rain. After harvest, he has to sell them at a cheaper price because he has to return the load he has taken during the plating time. He does not get loan  at cheaper interest from bank. So, he has to go to the Mahajans of his village and has to pay higher rate of interest. 
In addition to crops, a farmer keeps animals. He has to keep them for fertilizer, milk and calves for growing into oxen to pull his cart and for ploughing field. He has to keep busy himself.
Although, he has to pass a hard life, he is very helpful and hospitable to guests. He has limited expectation and when they are fulfilleld. He shows his happiness. He enjoys singing folk songs and celebrating traditional festivals. He enjoys with his family members and relatives.Any way, a farmer is a god for us all people.
42.Road Accidents.
Accidents are unfortunate events. They may take place any ime any where. We can see and hear many events like plane crash, boat accident road accident etc.The accidents that happen on the road are called road accidents
There are many causes behind the accidents. Lack of experience, over confidence, over crowded roads, are the causes of accident. The people walking along the road may cross the road from any where. They do not know traffice rules.
Somepeople take driving as amusement and drive carelessly. They even drive drinking and talking on the mobiles while driving.
The most important thing is discipline. If people are disciplined, they will follow a system. After peoplestart following a system, such events are easily controlled.
We should follow some measures to control accidents. We should train common people. We should make them awareof traffic rules. Giving of licence should be little strict. Incapable persons shouldnot be given a driving licence at any condition. The import of too many vehicles should be banned.
43.The accident i witnessed.
It was my frined's birthday. I was cycling towards his home with a frind. we were on our bicycles. SInce the road was wide and clean, we were cycling sid by side and talking. 
I was suprised hearing a noise behind me. I stopped my bicycle and turned to the noise. A girl and a man were lying down on the road. A bicyle and a motorbike were also lying down beside them. We turned back and rushed to the spot.
THe scene showed the motorbike had hit the bicycle. The girl was unable to stand up. She was our friend, Sarita. When we asked she told she felt pain on the leg. But, later we found she had no serious injury. My god! She was safe.
The motorbike rider was injured on the leg and hand. e had wounds on the knee. It was bleeding. The wound on the hand was also big. I thought might have been broken.
We called anambulance and took them to a nearby clinic. The health worker examined and said to sarita; she had no serious injury. So, she need not to go to the hospital. She went home after some time. But the man was seriously injured on the hand. We called his relative and sent him to the hospital.Later, I heard he was plastered there and got well.
44.Natural resources in the development of our country
We are rich in natural resources. If we can use them properly, we can be rich very soon. Water resources is the main source of our country. If we can use them, we can set up hydroelectric plants. Electricity can be used for industries, transport, mills, irrigation, in addtion to our every day use to light homes, to start TV, computer ,running simple mills.
If we can set uponly fifty percent of possible hydroelectric plants, we can export the electricity to earn money. In addition, we can irrigate all the land so that we can produce crops. We can sell them too. The next we can use the Himalayan forests and the dense forest of mountains and terai.
In the same way, we can use our jungles of all areas for national development. We can attract tourists and set up many industries on the basis of national parks. We can also use the hills to produce herbs and fruits. They will not only enough for us but we can export them too to earn money. ALl these developmentworks will generate employment.
45. Forests of Nepal.
We are rich in natural resources. we are rich in forest. We used to say 'Nepal ko dhan Hariyo ban. It's real.It is still true.
Our country has many geographical features. Climate is different in different geographical regions. In the Himalayan range, climate is cool. So the plants are small. The forests are not dense but we find very useful herbs. In the mountainous region the trees are small but keep greenery for long. We can turn them into fruitgardens. 
The terai region is the best place for forests. The 'Char Koshe Jhadi', whcih spreads from east to west, is a dense forest. It has very useful trees like Sal, Satisal, Sisau, Khayar.etc These forest are the stores of our national property. They give us timber, firewood, herbs,etc. They provides with shelter for wild animals and birds which are uncommon in the world.
The forest cause to rain, check floods and landslides.They produce enough oxygen and make the atmosphere fresh. They help keep  up the eco-system. We can develop them into national parks and reserve animals and birds. Therefore, forests of Nepal are very important for our lives, our progress and satisfication.
46.Wildlife conservation
Wildlife means living things of the jungle. It means the wild plants and animals. IN the same way, conservation means to save them. 
Wildlife is very much important for us. We can't live without it.The green plants produce oxygen. It is a must for us. The forests cause to rain  . So, other plants and food can be grown. Forests help us to check flood and landslide, too. They keep the atmosphere fresh . In addition , they provides us timber, firewood, and herbal pants. We can set up industries and get employment.
Forests ar ethe homes of wild animals, birds and insects. Because of the national parks and reserves of Nepal, we can save endangered animals like one-horned rhino, tigers, crocodiles and birds here. We can save them from being extinct.
The tourists who are fond of nature, visit our country. Students studying about wildlife visit our country and we can develop our tourism. We can create employment and earn money.
Every living things is a part of system. The absence of any one may affect the whole system. So, we will preservce our whole system in which we ar eliving, There fore, wildlife preservation is very important for our life and our economic development.
47.Rivers of the Nepal
Nepal is the country of natural resources. Rivers are very important national property. They are the boon of nature. Our country is known as the second richest country in the worl after Brazil.
Thousands of rivers flow through Nepal. Some rivers begin from the snow capped Himalayas. They are big and always flowing rivers. Koshi, Mechi, Arun, Gandaki, Karnali etc. are some example of these kinds.we can use them in irrigation, productin electricity for trnasport, for enterainment etc. We can attract tourists because of these rivers. We can preserve rare water animals in these rivers.
Some other begin from the Mahabharat range. These rivers are also permanent but they have a littl ewater in winter. These rivers are also used for irrigation, running water mils, small scale electric projects. etc.
The rest begin from the Siwalik Hills. They are big in the rainy days of summer but dry in winter. They are very dangerous in summer when it rains heavily. We caln also use them for irrigation.
They flood in summer and destroy our crops; sweep away our houses. We must be careful then, If we can use our rivers, we can develop our country. They are our assets.
48.Use of water resources
Neapl is a poor country but it is full of natural resources. We have many kinds of resources.Water resource is the major source. We have HImalayas, glaciers ever flowing permanent rivers, water falls, larges lakes etc. If we can use them properly, we can turn our poor country into a rich country.
We can use our rivers fro hydro electric power stations. WE can produce so much electricity that we do not need. Electricity provide us with light .We can use it for our domestic purpose such as lighting, heating, cooling, watching TV, operating computers, using refregerators, lifting water fro drinking and irrigation purposes etc. The major use of electricity will be to run large, medium and small scale industries etc. The next, we can use electricity for transport. So we need not buy petroliums from foreign countries.
The next important sector is that we can use water resources for irrigation. We can build small and big cannels for irrigating land. So, we can produce enough crops for the people and even for export . we can also use water for enterainment. We can build hotels on the banks of the river sna dlakes. They will attract domestic and foreign tourists. So, water resource is very important for us.
49.Irrigation
Irrigation means supplying water to teh lants grwoing in the fields. Water is life. No living things can live without water. Farmers  irrigate their small part of field by lifting water from teh local ponds with their muscle power. SOemtimes, they irrigate from teh wells.Some farmers have built some traditional canals to irrigate.
Nepal is an agricultural country. Therefore irrigation plays vital role in Nepalese economy The Nepalese farmers have to depend on seasonal rainfall for irrigating their fields. Sometimes, they cannot plant rice in time because of lack of rainfall. Sometimes, large plots of land are left fallow whole the year.
We are rich in water resources. If we can provide irrigation, we can grow enough food for us. Nepalese farmers can grow all seasonal crops all year ruond. They can produce grains, cereals, begetables, cash crops, furits etc. They can not only feed the whole people, but also can export the product. They can earn money. WE can make the Nepalese people rich very soon. Making people rich means to strengthen the economy of the country. It is obvious that we can make our country rich very soon.
50.Importance of Tourism in Nepal
Nepal is small but very beautiful country. Tourism can be very important industry for our country. It has the highest mountain, Mt.Everest, the ever flowing Himalayan Rivers, glaciers, large lakes, green valleys and lovely water falls, the national parks in the Terai and HImalayn range are all the attractions for tourists.Lumbini, the birth place of gautam Buddha, can be next attraction.
These all natural resources will be very important for our tourists industriy. The tourists of different kinds will come to Nepal. Some will come to see the natural resources, some to study its historical and religious places.
It needs a lot of money to set up other industries. But our natural beauty can be our capital for tourism. We can get many direct and indirect advantages from tourism. First of all, we will get employment like tourist guide driving etc. We can s tart hotels.We can sell our goods. Even farmers can get chance to sell their agricultural products.
However, some tourists may have criminal nature and commit crime any time. They may affect our traditioanl culture. For these all, the security system should be strict and we should be much careful.
51.Importance of Cottage Industries.
Cottage Industries are simple and small industries. We need many things in our every day life.We have to wear. We need soap. We need copies. We need matches to make fire.All these things are the procuts of cottage industries.
WE have some popular cottage industries. They are Palpali Dhaka, Karuwa of Tansen, Bhojpure Khukuri paper etc are popular goods of cottage industries. Cottage industries are very much important for the development of a country. They can be set up witha small amount of money in a small area. They can be set up in every village. WE can provide employment for the people of villages. Most people in the villages can use their leisure time in the industries.
We can use our bamboo, strwa ,as amterials from our forest and produce paper, scent, soap, matches etc. IN the same way, we cna use our cheap soil to make pots. We can develop our art and handicrafts. There are some disadvantages. These products may be little expensives, we may not get a big market and will have to be satisfied at a little profil. But we can be using the idle time and our energy which is running for no use.
52.Domesticated Animals in Nepalese Economy
We live in the villages. Farmers raise many  pet animals. Domesticated animals are the most important source of income for the farmers living in the rurals areas. They also play very important role in the national economy.
The major pet animals in our society are buffalo, cows, goats, sheep, hen, ducks, pigs etc. The main purpose of these pet animals is to get meat, eggs, milk wool, manure, calves and bullocks for their field works etc.
They also pet animals for their every day work. They are like oxen to plough field and for carrying loads for business and their home use. They use the buffaloes and bullocks to pull cart or some mills, too. The horses are used as means of transport. We ride horses to travel.They alos pull TOnga in the city areas.
Carts are very useful means of transport in the villages to help of farmers and they are pulled by the bullocks.
SOme even pet elephants. They do a lot of works. They carry heavy loads. They attract tourist s and for circuses.
THese animals help us to develop economic growth.
53.Modern Inventions
This is the age of science and technology. Our lives have been changed druing these few years because the inventions. Now we can live in warm place in a cold season, and can cool hot rooms and live in a cold room. IT is because of electricity. We can go any wehre in no time. The moon and Mars are still worshipped by us. But the scientists have visited and started studying to find out whether we can live there. The rockets are flying to the space. IF you have money, you  can go to the moon. These are possible due to transport.
We can talk to people living in any place of the world. If any even happens in any corrner of the world, it spreads all over the world in a second. These area ll because of the invention of communication. People's lives have been longer because of modern medicine and the technology.
Thus, the invention of electricity, transport, modern medicine and computers has made our lives advanced. WE have been living a miracle life in eyes of our forefathers.
But together, no news is heard where there is no accident. Every thing has both good and bad sides so we must tolerate them.ANy way, we have to live the world using these all inventions.
54.Transport means carrying things or people from one place to anther place. Transport is themajor cause to make th epresent world. Now we can go round the world within twenty four hours. WE went to the space and found out many facts. We are using goods made in Japan, China or Australia. People have gone to the foreign countries.
These all became possible because of transport. SO the invention of modern transport has made our lives easier, faster and more comfortable than before.
The bullock carts, boats, bicycle,rickshaw, auto rickshaw, bus, taxi, trucks, planes, ship, rockets all are the means of transport. These means of transport are used for our needs.
In those far off days, we had to walk fro a week to reach Kathmandu from Bhairahawa. Bu now,ewe can reach in a five hours's bus ride or by a flight of thirty five minute.
People have to face many problems in the places where there is no transport facility.They have to die because of minor disease. It adds comforts to our life. It is important to develop industries and business. NOw, we cannot imagine our lives in teh absence of modern means of transport.
55.Road Transport in Nepal
Transport means carrying goods orpeople from one place to antoher place. There are many means of transport. AIr transport means travelling by plane. WE do not have water transport because we do not have seas. Nepal is popular for road transport.
Most Nepali people walk on foot. They carry loads on their backs. Donkeys and mules are popular in the hills. BUllock carts are very popular means of road trnasport in the terai.
WE also have many means of transport. BIcycle, moterobike, rickshwa, bus,car, trucks, lorry etc. are popular mean sof trnasport on the roads. The buses and trucks are providing us with teh facility of plain areas.
Because of these , we have made our lives easier and comfortable. WE can travel from east to west and north to south. WE can reach even Mustang by road these days. The industrial an dbusiness sectors depends on road transport. In the abbsence of adequate road transport eh apples are rotten in mUstange, while we have to buy foreing apples at a higher rates.
Road transport is the main means of trnasport in Nepal. There are still many districts untocuhed by road transport. We have to develop a lot in this field.
56.Computer
Computer is an electronci machine. Itwa s developed from calculator machine. We can not say what it does. But we should say ' what it can not do!'. IT means computer sare uesd in every field of our lives.
